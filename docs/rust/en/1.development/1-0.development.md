# 1. Development in Rust

Here are the steps on how to develop this project on your local PC.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  - On Windows, you will also need to install the [Visual Studio C++ Build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ja/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - In the Kubernetes section of the settings screen, please check the box next to ‘Enable Kubernetes’.
- [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/) (latest version recommended), a tool that builds and deploys Docker images in bulk.
- [protoc](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies)
  - Windows:
    - Download the latest version of protoc-xx.y-win64.zip from [HERE](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/latest).
    - Extract the file bin\protoc.exe and put it somewhere in the PATH.
    - Verify installation by opening a command prompt and enter `protoc --version`.
  - Mac:
    - Run `brew install protobuf`
- Clone the repository.
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/mnitta220/microservices-demo-rust
  cd microservices-demo-rust/
  ```

## Visual Studio Code

For Rust development on your local PC, I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) with the **rust-analyzer** extension.

Once you have installed VSCode and rust-analyzer, you can start coding your Rust project. To do this:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root folder of your project.
1. Run the following command to start VSCode:
   ```sh
   code workspace.code-workspace
   ```
1. VSCode will open and rust-analyzer will start analyzing your code.

The source code for each service that was rewritten in Rust can be found in the following locations:

- frontend: /src/frontend
- productcatalog service: /src/productcatalogservice
- cart service: /src/cartservice
- ad service: /src/adservice
